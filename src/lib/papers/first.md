# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Why Use Markdown?

- **Simplicity**: Markdown is easy to write and read.
- **Compatibility**: It can be converted to HTML and other formats.
- **Portability**: Markdown files are plain text, making them highly portable.

**Headings:**

## H2

###### H6

function greet(name: string) {
	console.log('Hi', name);
}
```
